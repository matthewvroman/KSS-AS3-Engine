README
=================================
KSS is an AS3 blitting engine I've been working on it my spare time for when I decide to finally do some tile based independent projects. It's very much a work in progress and I can't guarentee that it is user friendly or even ready for public use. That said, anyone is free to use the framework I've set up here. A lot of changes and additions will come as I find the need for additional features. Some of this includes: Text, Buttons, Particles, Sound, Mouse Input, and more!
